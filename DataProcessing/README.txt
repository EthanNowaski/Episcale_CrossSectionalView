    * ExtractApiBasNucInfo.m: used to extract the apical node, basal node, and nucleus center information.
    * CalcCellHeight.m: used to calculate the cell height using the apical and basal nodes of each individual cell.
    * CalcNuclearPositioning.m: used to calculate the nuclear positioning using the apical node, basal node and 
     nucleus center of each individual cell.

   Note:
      1. TheExtractApiBasNucInfo.m must be ran first. 
      2. Then the files CalcCellHeight.m and CalcNuclearPositioning.m can be ran to extract the cell height and 
         nuclear positioning for any desired simulation.
